I guess I am starting to get to a point in my existence where I am noticing that I am not following my dreams. I am just too scared to try. I am afraid of letting myself down, letting my family down, and letting colleagues down. I am a lazy asshole, I am a procrastinator, I am Agoraphobic, I have anxiety, panic disorder, and ADD, this is true. But, when I set my mind to something, or I am tasked with something I love or that interests me, I go head first into it. I melt into it. I obsess about it. Point is, I don't want to do nothing. I want to do what I love. I want to write code, I want to learn about code. I want to write code for a career. I want to get back into school and get a degree in Web Development. I want to be happy in knowing that what I do makes me happy and in making me happy makes my family happy.
