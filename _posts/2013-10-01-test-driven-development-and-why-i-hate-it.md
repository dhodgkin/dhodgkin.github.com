TDD or BDD are the bane of my development life. I do see how they are useful but to me they just get in the way of the real code. I guess I am old school that way, I believe in just writing code and testing later. I don't see the point in wasting time writing tests when I can be writing actual code, and if the code I write doesn't work I just tweak it till it works and move on. Once I get to a certain point in my development process I refactor what I wrote to get rid of the clutter and then get back to adding new features. To me adding test is just adding an uneeded layer of pain in the ass.
