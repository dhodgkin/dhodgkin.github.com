I want this blog to be first and foremost a coding blog. But of course these "coding blogs" are a dime-a-dozen. So, I have been thinking of ideas to make this one slightly different. And none of them panned out so I decided, "Hey! I'll just wing it." So here we are an off the cuff, spontaneous coding (most of the time) blog. 
For the most part the posts will be fairly short. I don't want to bore. But I do want to illuminate on what I have learned in the wonderful world of development. So relax, grab some beer and try to follow me as best you can.
