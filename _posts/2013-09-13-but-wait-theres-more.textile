h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). posted on: {{ page.date | date_to_string }}

So I was thinking this page is getting a bit crowded and as I write long posts at times. I am feeling a need to trim it a bit by adding a "read more..." and seperate long post pages from the short ones. So I am rolling my sleeves up and editing things to accomodate this feature (not that it's going to be hard). Later on I may add a tag cloud or categories. I may also follow the social norm, pshhh yeah right.
