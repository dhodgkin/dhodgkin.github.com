I have been pretty depressed lately... and it hit me today. I miss code! I miss writing something and having it work. I miss having to spend an hour debugging it to figure out why it prints this instead of that. I miss coding!!!! I miss asking a friend how to use a certain function and getting "RTFM" in reply. I miss the bleery eyed daze after an all night hack session. I miss the discussions about the good and bad points of a certain language, editor or IDE. I miss all my code junky friends.
