So I have been checking out D&D 4e and D&D Next. Well, I started thinking 'I want to create my own ruleset for pen and paper RPGs'. Needless to say I have found it to be more difficult than I had imagined while reading the PHB and DMG. <!--more-->

Setting out to start my journey into tabletop game design I grabbed my notebook of graph paper, my 3.5e DMG, and some PDFs of the 4e books. Of course nose stuck in rulebook after rulebook just started to make my head spin. Pages of notes littered my desk.
My ideas are a mess of scribbles, notations, numbers and different formulas for combat and skill checks. 

I guess my conclusion of this is either stick with the tried and true path (d20 system) or venture forth and prepare for a long hard journey.
