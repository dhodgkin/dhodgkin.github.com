<h1>How I Want This Site to Work</h1>
<p class="meta">09 Dec 2012</p>
<p>I want this blog to be first and foremost a coding blog. But of course these &#8220;coding blogs&#8221; are a dime-a-dozen. So, I have <br />
been thinking of ideas to make this one slightly different. And none of them panned out so I decided, &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;ll just wing it.&#8221; So here we are an off the cuff, spontaneous coding (most of the time) blog. <br />
For the most part the posts will be fairly short. I don&#8217;t want to bore. But I do want to illuminate on what I have learned in the wonderful world of development. So relax, grab some beer and try to follow me as best you can.</p>
